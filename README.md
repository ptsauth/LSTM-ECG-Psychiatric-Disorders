##Introduction

Psychiatric disorders pose diagnostic challenges. This study leverages ultra-short ECG signals analyzed using LSTM networks to achieve robust classification of psychiatric disorders. The methodology integrates a sliding window approach and majority voting for increased accuracy and reduced preprocessing overhead.

Key highlights:

    Mean classification accuracy: 97.12% Â± 0.006
    Disorders classified: Bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia.

##Dataset

This study utilized the following datasets:

1. **Psychiatry-ECG Dataset**: Available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buraktaci/Psychiatry-ECG/data).
2. **MIMIC-IV-ECG-Ext-ICD Dataset**: Available on [PhysioNet](https://doi.org/10.13026/ypt5-9d58).
